Simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Java Swing.

Each department (CSE, EEE, BBA) can have up to 10 students.

Uses CSV files for storing student data persistently.

On app start, student data is loaded from the .csv file if it exists.

When you delete a student, it also updates the CSV file to remove that student.

Search students either by name or ID.
